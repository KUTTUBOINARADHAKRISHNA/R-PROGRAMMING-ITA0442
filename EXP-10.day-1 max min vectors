10. Write a R program to find the maximum and the minimum value of a given vector.  

INPUT :

nums = c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60)
print('Original vector:')
print(nums)   
print(paste("Maximum value of the said vector:",max(nums)))
print(paste("Minimum value of the said vector:",min(nums)))

OUTPUT :

> ms = c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60)
> print('Original vector:')
[1] "Original vector:"
> print(nums)   
[1] 10 20 30 40 50 60
> print(paste("Maximum value of the said vector:",max(nums)))
[1] "Maximum value of the said vector: 60"
> print(paste("Minimum value of the said vector:",min(nums)))
[1] "Minimum value of the said vector: 10"
