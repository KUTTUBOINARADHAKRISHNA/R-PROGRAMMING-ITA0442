8. a. Create Box plot for “weight” grouped by “Diet” b. Create a Histogram for “weight” features 
belong to Diet- 1 category c. Create Scatter plot for “ weight” vs “Time” grouped by Die

program :

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(ChickWeight, aes(x = Diet, y = Weight)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  ggtitle("Box Plot of Weight by Diet")

ggplot(ChickWeight[ChickWeight$Diet == 1, ], aes(x = Weight)) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  ggtitle("Histogram of Weight in Diet-1")

ggplot(ChickWeight, aes(x = Time, y = Weight, color = factor(Diet))) + 
  geom_point() + 
  ggtitle("Scatter Plot of Weight vs Time Grouped by Diet")
