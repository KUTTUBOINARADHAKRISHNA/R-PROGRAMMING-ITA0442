i. Compute the mean temperature(donâ€™t use build in function) ii.Extract the first five rows from 
airquality. iii.Extract all columns from airquality except Temp and Wind iv.Which was the coldest 
day during the period? v.How many days was the wind speed greater than 17 m

program :

data(airquality)
mean_temp <- sum(airquality$Temp) / nrow(airquality)
mean_temp
head(airquality, 5)
airquality[, !(names(airquality) %in% c("Temp", "Wind"))]
coldest_day <- which.min(airquality$Temp)
airquality[coldest_day, c("Day", "Month", "Temp")]
wind_count <- sum(airquality$Wind > 17)
wind_count
