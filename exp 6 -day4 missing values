6.(i) Find any missing values(na) in features and drop the missing values if its less than 10% else 
replace that with mean of that feature. (ii) Apply a linear regression algorithm using Least Squares 
Method on “Ozone” and “Solar.R” (iii)Plot Scatter plot between Ozone and Solar and add 
regression line created by above model

program :


data(ChickWeight)

ordered_data <- ChickWeight[order(ChickWeight$Weight), ]
grouped_data <- group_by(ordered_data, Diet)

tail(grouped_data, 6)

library(reshape2)

melted_data <- melt(ChickWeight, id.vars = c("Chick", "Time", "Diet"))

mean_cast_data <- dcast(melted_data, Diet ~ variable, mean)
